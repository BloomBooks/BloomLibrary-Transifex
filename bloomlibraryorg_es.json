    "Here's the problem Bloom addresses: when working in local-language literacy projects, we end up settling for what is practical, instead of what is actually needed. The hope is often that a primer and a handful of books will be enough to open up the joy and power of reading in minority language communities. But realistically, we know that it takes <i>stacks</i> of titles to make reading worthwhile and give the practice needed to develop true literacy. The problem has been who will make all those books? How will we find the time? Where will we get the content? So we settle for the possible and hope for the best.": "El desafío que Bloom enfrenta: cuando estamos desarrollando proyectos de alfabetización en lenguas locales, muchas veces nos resignamos a lo que es práctico, en vez de lo que realmente se necesita.  Frecuentemente se espera que una cartilla y unos libros serán suficientes para cultivar el gozo y poder de leer dentro de las comunidades de idiomas minoritarias.  Pero sabemos que require un <i>montón</i> de libros para incentivar la alfabetización y la práctica que se necesita para desarrollar alfabetismo real. ¿Pero quién producirá tantos libros?  ¿Cómo encontraremos el tiempo para hacerlo? ¿Dónde encontraremos el contenido?  Entonces nos damos por vencidos y aceptamos lo posible y tratamos confiar que todo salga bien.",
