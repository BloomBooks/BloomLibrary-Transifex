    "Here's the problem Bloom addresses: when working in local-language literacy projects, we end up settling for what is practical, instead of what is actually needed. The hope is often that a primer and a handful of books will be enough to open up the joy and power of reading in minority language communities. But realistically, we know that it takes <i>stacks</i> of titles to make reading worthwhile and give the practice needed to develop true literacy. The problem has been who will make all those books? How will we find the time? Where will we get the content? So we settle for the possible and hope for the best.": "Voici le problème auquel Bloom répond : lorsqu'on travaille dans un projet d'alphabétisation en langue locale, on se contente de ce qui est pratique au lieu de ce qui est réellement nécessaire. L'espoir est souvent qu'un premir livre et une poignée de livres sera suffisant pour démarrer la joie et la puissance de la lecture dans la communauté de langue minoritaire. Mais en réalité, on sait qu'il faut un <i>tas</i> de titres pour rendre la lecture valable et donner la pratique nécessaire pour développer une vraie alphabétisation. Le problème a été : Qui fera tous ces livres ? Comment trouvera-t-on le temps ? Où obtiendra-t-on le contenu ? Donc, on se contente de ce qui est possible et on croise les doigts.",
